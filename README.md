## Improvement and Fixes

The search API in the back-end doesn't work properly it doesn't display accurate search result. and i believe that should be fixed else it will cause a terrible user experience. but for this challenge i have sent a request using ?search={query} and there is nothing to change in the front-end.


* The like part in the frontend doesn't work it needs a backend but its something the project should consider.
